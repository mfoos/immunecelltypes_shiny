About 80% of my job is writing Shiny apps to help scientists mine gene expression data, including varying levels of filtering, transformation and analysis. I love it, and it melds my coding and communication skills with my biology background. But since the fruits of my labor are limited by IP concerns, I want my name on some stuff others can use.

I've had some odd performance issues that I've been unable to pin down, so if you visit the app on shinyapps.io and get a timeout or script error, I'd love it if you'd file an issue. Thanks!
